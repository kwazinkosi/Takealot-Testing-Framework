//=========Pipeline Setup for Project Documentation
This document outlines the pipeline setup within Jenkins. It details the stages involved in the pipeline, the actions performed in each stage, and any dependencies or requirements for successful execution.

//====Pipeline Stages:
The pipeline was configured with the following stages:

1.	Checkout: This stage retrieves the source code from the GitLab repository.
	Uses the git command to clone the code from the specified GitLab URL provided in the Jenkinsfile.
	Requires the Git executable to be installed and configured on the Jenkins server.

2.	Build: This stage performs the build process for the Amazon automation code.
	Typically involves running commands like mvn clean package to compile and package the code for deployment to AWS.
	May include additional steps specific to a project, such as building infrastructure definitions using tools like CloudFormation.
o	Dependencies:
	Might depend on build tools like Maven or specific build scripts within your project.

3.	Test :This stage runs tests for the automation code.
	May use tools like mvn test to execute unit or integration tests.
	Could involve additional testing frameworks depending on the project's requirements.

4.	Clean :This stage cleans up resources after the pipeline execution.
	Involves deleting temporary files or build artifacts.
	May not be necessary in all pipelines.
Trigger:
	•	The pipeline can be triggered manually or configured to run automatically based on a schedule (e.g., cron expression) defined within Jenkins.
	•	Alternatively thriggers can be configured within the Jenkinsfile.

//====Dependencies and Requirements:
	•	Git: A working Git installation is required on the Jenkins server to access the GitLab repository.
	•	Jenkinsfile: A Jenkinsfile script containing the pipeline definition needs to be present in the root directory of the  application. This script defines the stages, actions, and triggers for the pipeline.
	•	Credentials: Credentials (username/password or personal access token) need to be configured within Jenkins to access the GitLab repository if it's private.
	•	Build Tools : Depending on the build process, specific tools like Maven or CloudFormation might be required and configured within Jenkins or your project. Including installation of any other plugins.
